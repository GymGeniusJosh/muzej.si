1. Purpose and Introduction
     
     The purpose of this document is to explain the functionality of the
     INI files (MOUSEDRV.INI, CURSOR.INI and MOUSECC.INI) and the Windows
     95 registry. This document provides a detailed explanation of the
     parameters contained within these files and how they can be modified.
     Many of the parameters which are stored in the INI files can be set
     from the DOS command line or from the Windows and DOS mouse control
     center; these include all mouse parameters that most users would want
     to modify. This document is intended, therefore, for advanced users
     with a need to alter these other parameters or who need to understand
     the mouse driver in greater detail. Since modification of some of
     these parameters can adversely affect the operation of your mouse,
     changes to the INI files or registry should be made with extreme care.
     Do not attempt to modify any of the INI file parameters without
     reading and thoroughly understanding the relevant section in this
     file.
     
     The INI files store any changes made to the default mouse settings
     from the Windows and DOS mouse control center, as well as some other
     more technical parameters. This insures that changes made from either
     control center will be maintained when the system is rebooted. It also
     allows for changes made from the DOS mouse control center to be
     reflected in the Windows environment and vice versa.
     Under Windows 95, the configuration information is stored the registry
     instead of INI files.


2. Format of MOUSEDRV.INI File

     The parameters in the MOUSEDRV.INI file are grouped in sections under
     a section header in the following format:

                   [section name]
                   parameter=value

     The square brackets ([]) in the [section name] are required. Section
     names must start in the leftmost column. Within each section are one
     or more "parameter=value" statements. Initially, all of these values
     will be default values set by the mouse driver itself. If the
     MOUSEDRV.INI file is deleted, the driver will recreate this file with
     the default values. This can be useful if the MOUSEDRV.INI file
     becomes corrupted and you wish to return to default values.


2. Configuration in Windows 95

     The information in the registry must be accessed with the 'REGEDIT'
     application located in the Windows directory. The information is
     stored in a similar way as INI files except that sections are
     organized in a tree format.
     
     Configuration information for the driver is located under:
     
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Logitech\MouseWare\CurrentVersion
     
     

3. MOUSEDRV.INI File Parameters

     The MOUSEDRV.INI parameters are described below in roughly the same
     order as they appear in the MOUSEDRV.INI file itself. The order of
     entries can change based on the number of devices connected to the
     system.


3.1. [Global] Section
     
     When the mouse driver initializes in searches for a pointing device
     among possible ports. This section contains parameters which pertain
     to this search.
     
     
     3.1.1. ForcedConnection=
     Determines if the mouse driver will search for the mouse first on the
     port specified by 'Connection' and/or 'ConnectionPort' parameters or
     will use the 'PortSearchOrder' parameter.
     
          Valid values:
     
          On            Use Connection information to find the mouse
          
          Off           Perform a full search for mouse each launch time
                        using the search order given below.
          
          Default value = on
     
     
     3.1.2. SearchOrder=
     The driver searches the computer's ports for the connected mouse
     (mice) in the order given.
     
          Valid values:

          Bus           Search for a bus mouse
          
          Inport        Search for a Microsoft Inport mouse
          
          PS2           Search for a PS/2 mouse
          
          Serial        Search for a Serial mouse (M-series and C-series)
     
          Default value = PS2, Serial, Bus, Inport.
     
     
     3.1.3. PortSearchOrder=
     Lists the order the serial ports are searched. This is valid only for
     a Serial device.
     
          Valid values:

          COM1          search on comport 1
          COM2          search on comport 2
          COM3          search on comport 3
          COM4          search on comport 4
          
          Default value = COM1, COM2.
     
     
     3.1.4. ActiveMouse#=
     This parameter indicates which [DeviceType] section is used. The
     number sign indicates which device this refers to. If there is only
     one mouse connected no number will appear (value of zero). If there is
     a second device this will be number one, two for the third device,
     etc.
     
          Valid values:
     
          please refer to the '[DeviceType]' section below
          
          Default value is determined by the connected mouse
     
     
     3.1.5. ConnectionPort#=
     Current comport used by mouse. This is valid only for a serial device.
     The number sign indicates which device this refers to. If there is
     only one mouse connected no number will appear (value of zero). If
     there is a second device this will be number one, two for the third
     device, etc.
     
          Valid values:

          COM4          Serial COM port 4
          
          Default value is determined by connected mouse
     
     
     3.1.6. Connection#=
     This indicates the type of hardware port the mouse is connected to.
     The number sign indicates which device this refers to. If there is
     only one mouse connected no number will appear (value of zero). If
     there is a second device this will be number one, two for the third
     device, etc.
     
          Valid values:

     default setting will allow the driver to look for the best location
     available in memory. The driver will try to relocate itself first in
     extended memory, next in upper memory and finally in conventional
     memory. This default behavior can be overridden by assigning a value
     from the list below. In case an option cannot be satisfied, the next
     lower region of memory will be used.
     
          Valid values:

3.4. [DeviceType] Section
     Each connected device will have its own section defining that device's
     characteristics. The 'DeviceType' name will be a text string
     describing the mouse model as follows. Values written here are for
     mice that can identify themselves (e.g. MouseMan) or for general
     groups of mice (e.g. SerialM). For unidentifiable mice, the
     'DeviceModel' parameter may be used to specify a device shape. By
     default, the DeviceModel name will be the same as the DeviceType.
     
     Note for DOS dual mode: Only one device's [DeviceType] section will be
     supported at a time. For dual mode, the DOS mouse driver will write
     out the second mouse's [DeviceType] section but will not use it. Only
     the first mouse found section will be used. To indicate the active
     device section, the parameter 'ActiveMouse' will be used. Please see
     ActiveMouse description in the [Global] section.
     
     Under Windows, if more that one instance of the same device model is
     connected to the system, the additional device instance(s) will have a
     4 digit instance count appended to it (them).
     
     These sections store the parameters which are specific to each device
     such as speed and acceleration. Generaly these parameters will be set
     from the DOS or Windows mouse control center or by a DOS command line
     parameter. For a complete list of all of these parameters type "mouse

3.5. [COMx] Section
     This section defines the COM ports used by the computer. This section
     allows advanced users to configure their mouse for atypical IRQ values
     and non-standard COM port address. The 'x' value must be filled in by
     the user as must the values in this section. Valid values for 'x' are:
     1, 2, 3, and 4. If you are using a serial bus board which allows non-
     standard configurations, you must set the values in this section to
     match the corresponding values on your serial board. The driver cannot
     set these automatically.
     
     
     3.5.1 BaseAddress=
     The base address of the COM port (given in hexadecimal).
     
          Valid values:
          
          valid hexidecimal value which depends on the hardware.
          
          Default value: COM1=3F8, COM2=2F8, COM3=3E8, COM4=2E8
     
     
     3.5.2 IRQValue=
     The IRQ value of the COM port (given in decimal).
     
          Valid values:
          
          determined by hardware
          
          Default value: COM1=4, COM2=3, COM3=4, COM4=3
     
     Note:
     The COM3 and COM4 values are synchronized with the Windows values. Use
     the Windows Ports control panel to modify the ports values.
     
     
     3.5.3 DeviceModel=
     Devices that cannot be detected automatically can be specified under
     this entry. Do not use.
     
          Valid values:
          
          Driver supported device types
     

3.6. [DISPLAY]
     The sections controls the generation of the mouse cursor when running
     some super VGA capable DOS programs. Super VGA (SVGA) is defined
     loosely as any mode above the VGA standard established by IBM. The
     various video card manufacturers have implimented the SVGA modes
     differently. This presents a problem for when running DOS programs
     which require the mouse driver to draw the mouse cursor. To do this,
     the mouse driver must have knowledge of the underling video
     architecture and the current video mode.
     
     To remedy this problem, the Video Electronics Standards Association
     (VESA) and Logitech Inc. have established the Video Cursor Interface
     (VCI) Standard. This standard outlines the interface between an input
     device, such as a mouse, and a small overlay program containing
     hardware dependent cursor movement and drawing code. The host (or
     mouse driver in this case) calls the VCI module to perform all cursor
     functions. The host need not have any knowledge of the cursor drawing
     software/hardware.
     
     The VCI module can be implemented in one of three ways: as an overlay
     program that the host program loads, as a TSR/device driver program
     that redirects INT 10h calls to itself, as ROM resident code.
     
     The mouse driver itself contains the code for implimenting VCI
     support. The following parameters may be used to enable the driver to
     use an external VCI overlay instead.
     
     
     3.6.1. UseVCIOverlay=
     The driver can use an external video overlay instead of its built-in
     video code. This flag will enable or disable the search for such a
     module.
     
          Valid values:
          
          On            Attempt to load the video overlay specified in the
                        VideoModule keyname.
          
          Off           Use the mouse driver's built-in video code.
          
          Default value=Off
     
     
     3.6.2. VideoModule=
     Location of the VESA VCI video cursor overlay. This value is either a
     file name, the keyword RESIDENT, or blank for no external VCI support.
     If only a file name is present, the driver will assume that the VCI
     file is located in the driver directory. By default, the directory
     where MOUSEDRV.INI is located is used. If the overlay cannot be found
     or has an incorrect format, the driver will revert to its internal
     video code.
     
          Valid values:
          
          A path and file name of VCI file. If only a file name is
          present, the driver will assume that the VCI file is located in
          the same directory as the MOUSEDRV.INI file.
          
          RESIDENT  The VCI module is resident in memory.
          
          Value is blank Indicates no external VCI module.
          
          Default value is left blank
     

3.7. [WinGlobal] Section
     The section describes the settings used by the Windows mouse driver.
     
     
     3.7.1. UseDOSDriver=
     This parameter enables the use of the DOS mouse driver under Windows

     before launching Windows.
     
          Valid values:
          
          On            Use the DOS mouse driver under Windows. The mouse
                        functionality will then be limited.
