                 HOW TO USE THE MOO MENU SYSTEM

1.  LAUNCHING PROGRAMS

MOO is a menu system to help you launch programs.

Click your mouse on the program that you want to run.  Or
highlight the program (using the arrow keys -- or typing the
item's first letter), and then hit ENTER.

If there's more items than fit on the screen, hit one of the
keys listed at the bottom of the menu (- PgUp Home End PgDn +)
to see more items.  Or click on a key-name with your mouse.
Or use your mouse to click or drag on the scrollbar.

2.  MOO FILES

MOO consists of some program/help files starting with "MOO,"
plus any number of menu files ending in ".MOO" (like
"MAINMENU.MOO").  Each menu file can hold 500 items.  These
files should be in some subdirectory on your PATH.

There's "MOO for DOS" and "MOO for Windows."  Either can set up
MOO menus for your programs, or run programs from existing MOO
menus.  Both use the same menu format.

MOO for DOS uses files MOO1.EXE and MOO2.BAT (don't rename
either), a startup file (usually called MOO.BAT), and three help
files that display within MOO (MOO.DOC, MOO-ED.DOC, and
MOO-LITE.DOC).  To load or create a MOO menu from the DOS
prompt, enter "MOO" followed by the menu name (1 to 8 characters
-- you may omit ".MOO").  Entering "MOO" alone is the same as
typing "MOO MAINMENU"; this loads MAINMENU.MOO.

MOO for Windows uses files MOOW.EXE, MOOWEDIT.EXE, MOOW.HLP,
and MOOWEDIT.HLP (don't rename the last three).  You can start
MOOW.EXE from Windows in the normal ways; you can install it on
the Program Manager, for example, or double-click on it from
the Windows File Manager.  Run "MOOW MENUNAME" to load a
specific menu.

You're now reading MOO.DOC.  The three DOC files focus on MOO
for DOS.  For info on MOO for Windows, start MOOW.EXE from
Windows.

MOO comes with two sample MOO menus to explore (MAINMENU.MOO and
SAMPLE.MOO), three files for customizing MOO (MOO-FULL.BAT,
MOO-LITE.BAT, and MOO-NET.BAT), a short FREERAM.COM to help you
see the memory demands of MOO's execution modes, and a
README.TXT file.  MOO may produce temporary MOO$...BAT files
for executing programs.

3.  THE FILE MENU

NEW MENU creates a blank untitled menu.  Add the items that you
want, and then save the menu to the disk.

OPEN OLD MENU displays your MOO menus, and lets you open one.

You might want to keep copies on your disk of MOO menus that you
set up for friends, relatives, or clients.  You can display the
menus if they phone for help.

SAVE MENU TO DISK (Alt-S) saves menu changes, so that you don't
lose them.  As you edit a menu, save it frequently.

SAVE MENU AS saves the current menu under a different name.  You
can use this to make backups of your menus.

REVERT TO MENU ON DISK cancels changes to a menu since your last
save.  Use this when you mess things up.

FIND FILE (Alt-I) locates files on the hard disk, so you can add
them to the menu.

CREATE MENU AUTOMATICALLY puts all the programs on your disk
into a menu.  You can include DOS programs, or Windows programs,
or both.  MOO may sometimes guess wrong on whether a program
runs under DOS or Windows.

This gives a quick way to set up a hard disk.  You'll have to
clean up the menu a bit -- replacing "Wp" with a title like
"WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS," for example.

PRUNE OFF NONEXISTENT ITEMS marks items that refer to
nonexistent programs or directories.  You can then erase the
items, or correct the program or directory names.

Use this to check a menu's accuracy -- after you create it or
after you've erased or relocated programs.

EXIT PROGRAM (F5 or Alt-Q) quits the MOO menu program.

4.  THE EDIT MENU

MODIFY MENU ITEMS (Alt-M) lets you add, modify, or drop menu
items.  DEFAULT MODE changes execution modes.  For more info,
pick "How to edit menu items" from the "Help" menu.

SWITCH TO LIMITED MENUS turns off options that modify MOO menus.
Use this to make MOO easier for novice users -- or to keep
children or employees from changing menus.

You can start MOO from the DOS prompt in three ways.  Entering
"MOO-FULL" puts you into full-menu mode.  "MOO-LITE" puts you
into limited-menu mode.  And "MOO-NET" puts you into a
limited-menu mode for network use which gives each user an
individual temporary MOO$...BAT file for executing programs.

To have the "MOO" command from DOS start in one of these ways,
copy "MOO-FULL.BAT" or "MOO-LITE.BAT" or "MOO-NET.BAT" to
overwrite "MOO.BAT."  You can rename this startup file to
whatever you like (e.g., "MENU.BAT").

If you don't want to add the MOO-directory to your PATH, you can
put the startup file (e.g., MOO.BAT) in some directory on your
path, and then add commands to switch drive and directory (e.g.,
"C:" and "CD \MOO") after its third line.  Or you can switch to
the MOO-directory before starting MOO.

SET PASSWORD FOR USING FULL MENUS lets you require that only
users who know your password be allowed to switch to full menus.
Use this (with the MOO-LITE or MOO-NET sign on) to provide
security against the menus begin modified.  For even greater
security, remove the MOO-FULL.BAT, MOO.DOC, and MOO-ED.DOC files
from the disk -- or make your MOO menu files read-only.

5.  THE ADAPT MENU

This has eleven options for customizing menu appearance, sound
effects, the screen blanker, etc.  MOO for Windows has further
options (e.g., font and Windows colors) for how the same menu
displays under MOO for Windows.

6.  THE HELP MENU

HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM (F1) displays the MOO.DOC file that
you're now reading.

HOW TO EDIT MENU ITEMS (F2) displays the MOO-ED.DOC file.

ABOUT MOO gives an "About" box.

If you're in limited-menu mode, the first option will display
MOO-LITE.DOC, and the second option won't exist.

You can modify these MOO...DOC files, if you save them in a text
(ASCII) format and keep under 8000 bytes.  You can use
MOO-LITE.DOC to tell users about the programs on the computer,
hours of operation, who to contact in case of trouble, etc.

Or you could print these files (enter "COPY MOO*.DOC PRN" from
the DOS prompt) and then erase them.

7.  TECHNICAL DETAILS

I wrote MOO 3.1 in Borland's Turbo Pascal.  I used Teddy
Matsumoto's DIET to compress MOO1.EXE.  MOO for DOS requires DOS
3.0 or later, and 200-K available RAM (but can use 0-K RAM when
running a program).  MOO for Windows MOO requires Windows 3.0 or
later (standard or enhanced mode only), and about 60-K available
RAM (plus 150-K more RAM when editing menus).
