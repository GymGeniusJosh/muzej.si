                   HOW TO EDIT MOO MENU ITEMS

1.  MOO MENU ITEMS

Menus contain programs, comments/titles, and links to other
menus.  MOO alphabetizes the items after you change them. 
Spaces alphabetize before numbers, and numbers before letters.

Start an item with a space ("  HARRY'S PROGRAMS") or a number
("1.  Go to WINDOWS menu") to put it at the beginning.  Space
out an item ("A M I  --  Ami Pro") to make it go first under a
given letter; you can then hit that letter plus ENTER to execute
the program.

2.  HOW MANY MENUS?

You may prefer to keep your programs on a single MOO menu.  If
you call it MAINMENU, you can sign on using just "MOO."

Or you could use several menus -- MAINMENU, UTILITY, GAMES,
WINDOWS, etc. -- plus maybe a KATHY menu for your daughter's
programs.  You'd want to add links between your menus.  So
MAINMENU would have a "Go to UTILITY menu" item, and UTILITY
would have "Go to MAINMENU."

3.  MODIFYING MENU ITEMS

"Modify menu items" (Alt-M) on the "Edit" menu lets you modify,
add, or drop menu items.  For each item, you specify a NAME
(that displays in the menu), a PASSWORD (optional), and COMMANDS
(for executing the program).  The screen gives basic directions.
Here are further hints:

Save your work often, using "Save" (Alt-S) on the "File" menu. 

When you mess things up, use "Revert to menu on disk" on the
"File" menu.  This cancels changes since your last save.

Ctrl+END deletes to the end of the line.

Use upper ASCII characters (Alt + numlock-numbers) to type
special characters.  If you want these to display correctly in
MOO for Windows, you may have to use the Windows "DOS font."

4.  BASIC PROGRAM COMMANDS

Most of your item commands will look like one of these:

  c:~cd\wp~wp.exe

  c:\wp\wp.exe

Both execute identically.  Each switches to the "C:" drive,
makes "\WP" the current directory, and starts "WP.EXE"
(WordPerfect).  The tilde ("~") separates lines.

Here's a more complex example:

  c:~cd\letters~c:\wp\wp.exe business.ltr

This switches to the "C:" drive, makes "\LETTERS" the current
directory, and starts "WP.EXE" with the file "BUSINESS.LTR."  If
you omit the ".exe" in "wp.exe," these examples will still work.
But the "Prune nonexistent items" command may not work as well.

Here's a technical definition.  A "BASIC program command" ends
with the name of an executable program (a file ending in ".EXE"
or ".COM" or ".BAT"), only includes ONE such program, and may
have prior lines that change a drive or directory.

5.  EXTENDED PROGRAM COMMANDS

"EXTENDED program commands" may also contain internal DOS
commands (like "DIR" and "COPY") and batch file commands (like
"ECHO" and "PAUSE") -- and may execute more than one program. 
Here's an example:

  echo Put backup disk in drive A.~pause~copy c:\moo\*.moo a:

This displays "Put backup disk in drive A.  Press any key to
continue . . ." and waits for you to hit a key.  Then it copies
your MOO menus from directory C:\MOO to a floppy in drive A.

EXTENDED commands always execute using a temporary MOO$...BAT
file.  Except in no-ram mode 1, BASIC commands execute directly
(and hence more quickly).  Keep to the BASIC format when running
Windows programs.

6.  SPECIAL COMMANDS

For comments or titles (which don't execute anything), leave
"COMMANDS" blank.  Here are some other special COMMANDS (which
you can type in upper or lower case):

  game.moo

This loads the "GAME.MOO" menu.  To switch to another menu, type
its full name (including ".MOO").

  c:\util\whereis.com ^Give filenames (wildcards OK)^

This displays the "^...^" message (of up to 70 characters), asks
for a response, replaces the message with what you type, and
then executes the command.  You can include as many "^...^"
messages as you like.

  rem This is a comment for your own use.~c:\wp\wp.exe

"REM" (short for "remark") tells MOO to ignore everything up to
the next tilde.  Any kind of item (except comments/titles) can
have any number of remarks.

  dos

This gives a DOS prompt (a temporary exit to DOS).

  quit

DOS MOO will ignore this, while Windows MOO will end your
current Windows session and put you back in DOS.

  win

Windows MOO will ignore this, while DOS MOO will start Windows
(if it's on your PATH).

The "moo" and "moolite" commands from version 2.0 of MOO are
obsolete.  You now use the "Edit" menu to switch between
full-moo and moo-lite.  And "~~~~" is now "dos."

For further examples, explore the sample MOO menus.

7.  EXECUTION MODES

NOTE:  This section is for MOO power users.  If you are a MOO
novice, stay with mode 1 (no-ram) and skip this section.

Mode 1 is No-ram.  MOO unloads and runs the program from a batch
file, taking 0-K RAM from your program.  Use mode 1 when running
programs that are memory-resident -- or don't run correctly in
the other modes -- or need all of your RAM.

Mode 2 is Piggyback.  MOO remains loaded, taking about 186-K RAM
from your program.  Use mode 2 for faster execution of small
programs (like "FORMAT.COM") that don't use much RAM.  Skip mode
2 if you have less than 384-K RAM.

Mode 3 is Swap.  MOO swaps to EMS, taking 2- to 5-K RAM from
your program.  Use mode 3 for faster execution of large programs
(like WordPerfect) that need all your lower RAM.  Mode 3
requires 176-K of expanded memory; if you don't have this, MOO
uses mode 1 instead.  Mode 3 uses TurboPower's EXECSWAP routine.

Mode 4 is Windows.  MOO unloads completely (since Windows needs
all your RAM), loads Windows, and then runs you program through
MOO for Windows.  Use mode 4 if you want to execute Windows
programs from MOO for DOS.  (Mode 5 is like mode 4, but runs the
Windows program as an icon.)

You set the default execution mode from the "Edit" menu.  You
can override the default mode for particular programs, by
starting the COMMANDS line with 1-5 tildes ("~") for modes 1-5. 
Here's an example:

  ~~c:\dos\format.com a:

This runs in mode 2 (piggyback) regardless of the default mode.

  ~~~~c:\windows\ami\amipro.exe

This runs in mode 4 (Windows) regardless of the default mode. 
MOO for DOS will ask if you want to load Windows and Ami Pro
(AMIPRO.EXE) at the same time.  MOO marks your Windows programs
with "~~~~" when you have it automatically create a menu.

Execution modes apply mainly to MOO for DOS.

8.  EDITING MENUS USING A WORD PROCESSOR

Sometimes it's more convenient to edit a MOO menu using a word
processor or text editor -- to use search and replace, for
example, or to cut and paste between files.  Retrieve and save
the MOO menu as an text (ASCII) file, and avoid splitting
COMMANDS (which contain up to 128 characters) between lines.

MOO menus follow a simple format.  The first two lines contain
settings that you should change only within MOO.  After that,
you have editable three-line units consisting of NAME OF ITEM
(on lines divisible by 3) + COMMANDS + PASSWORD.
